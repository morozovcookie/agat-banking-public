pages
-----

This folder contains declaration of pages used in web application. Page is the container of separate components. If you 
need to create a component you could define it in private component folder inside page folder. But if you want to use 
this component in several pages or other components than you should move it to global component folder.

Every page should be placed in separate folder and imported in [index.js](index.js) file.
